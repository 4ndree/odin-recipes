# odin-recipes
#In this project I want to make a simple website that displays various recipes with photos of the final look(eg. cake), I want to use all my knowledge in html so I'll use images, links, lists( ordered and unordered), paragraphs and different headings.
It is not supposed to look good as I will only use html.
